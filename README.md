## Description

React/Node.js webapp that relies solely on Redis and its lightweight, persistent nature to store user data. Fast without the bulk of a RDBMS or NoSQL data store.

## Use case

I have been using Redis for a while now to store my session data but I only ever interacted with redis using a third party lib, never directly. Curios about how the Redis datastore was different from other datastores, this is a project meant as a deep dive in understanding the core functionality of redis and useful redis commands.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Redis
- ReactJS
- Node-Redis
- ES6
- React-Bootstrap
